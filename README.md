# CSV Reader
A working name for a simple python script to process downloaded monthly bank statements.

## How it works
It currently works by loading configurations from a 'config.yaml' to help assign budget buckets and their corresponding values. The script is ran by using command line arguments. You can supply the filename you want to process and an optional -e to export the result to Google sheets.

## Roadmap
- Add better export formats
- Cleanup bucket assignment logic 
- Configure a yearly DataFrame
